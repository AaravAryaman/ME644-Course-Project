# ME644-Course-Project
Implemented fundamental ML algorithms from scratch in Python, including k-NN, Linear & Logistic Regression, Steepest Descent,
and a single-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Conducted System Identification of a pendulum by applying Ridge Regression to experimental data to discover its governing equation.
Developed models, performed data validation using LOOCV, and plotted decision boundaries using only NumPy and Matplotlib.
